# convex-convolution
Python code for stroking a convex polygon along a polyline.

This is an implementation of the same algorithm as this ([Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@theohonohan/minkowski-sum-of-polygons-an-elliptical-pen-on-a-bezier-curv). The final cleanup stage is unimplemented.

### Unimplemented features
What's missing is code to clean up the cuspsâ€”in the JS version, this is handled by [libtess2](https://github.com/memononen/libtess2). In Python, the GLU Tesselator is available via OpenGL and Kivy.

Sample code on using the tesselator from the OpenGL library:
https://github.com/mcfletch/openglcontext/blob/master/OpenGLContext/scenegraph/polygontessellator.py

Info on the Kivy option, which may not be fully supported:
