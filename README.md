# convex-convolution
Python code for stroking a convex polygon along a polyline.

This is an implementation of the same algorithm as https://observablehq.com/@theohonohan/minkowski-sum-of-polygons-an-elliptical-pen-on-a-bezier-curv. What's missing is code to clean up the cuspsâ€”in the JS version, this is handled by libtess2. In Python, the GLU Tesselator is available via OpenGL and Kivy.

Info on using the tesselator from the OpenGL library:

Info on the Kivy option, which may not be fully supported:
